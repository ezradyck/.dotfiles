# Dotfiles

Contains config files that can be used across other systems.

## NOTES

- Terminal session will have to be restarted after running the symlink script to get zshrc and .gitconfig to apply
- Currently there is no checking in symlink for existing files.
- Symlink script written for bash, i.e., no support for PowerShell yet.

## TODO

- Symlink script is quite shaky and needs to be better.
- Determine if I actually want .gitconfig in this repo or if I would be better suited finding a way to source git aliases from another file.
